# Piton 2000

**Special equipment is required to run these scripts, see the Setup section for more info.**

Piton 2000 is a service that can connect to the Dutch P2000 network to monitor the messages send by alarm centers to the Fire Departments, Police stations, Ambulance services or the KNRM(Royal Dutch Coast Guard).  
Build with Python 2.7.15

## Examples
This section features some small examples on how to use or extend these scripts.

#### Custom Reader
```python
import p2000.rtlsdr as rtlsdr
from p2000.rtlsdr import AbstractReader


class MyReader(AbstractReader):

    def act(self, raw):
        line = self.create_line(raw)
        if self.is_line_blacklisted(line):
            print("== LINE IS BLACKLISTED ==")
        else:
            print(str(line))


connection = rtlsdr.Connection()
reader = MyReader()
reader.attach(connection)

```

#### Fetching Units
```python
from p2000 import Region, Discipline
from p2000.storage.units import Scraper


# Scraping for a single Region.
scraper = Scraper(Region.FRIESLAND)
units = scraper.get_units(Discipline.FIRE_DEPARTMENT)

for discipline in units:
    print("{0} Size = {1}".format(
        discipline[0].discipline,
        len(discipline)
    ))
```

#### Writing and Searching Units to and from the database.
```python
from p2000 import Region, Discipline
from p2000.storage.units import Scraper, Connection

# Fetching the raw data.
scraper = Scraper(Region.FRIESLAND)
units = scraper.get_units(Discipline.FIRE_DEPARTMENT)

# Open the Database.
connection = Connection().establish()
# Write a single unit.
connection.write_unit(units[0])
# Or write all the units.
connection.write_units(units)
# Search for multiple units, a limit can be set as wel, default limit is unlimited.
units = connection.find_units("0300050", limit=10)
```

## Setup
**I am using Ubuntu 18.04 for this setup, i haven't tested any other Linux versions!!!**

It is only possible to use this service if you have a certain USB radio + antenna.  
- For the Dutch readers, [you can get it from  Bol.com][1].  
- For the international readers, [you can get it from  HackerWarehouse][2].  

Or you could get it anywhere else, as long as it has the `RTL2832U` chipset and a `R820T` tuner, this makes it possible to function as a generic radio.  

To actually get some input from the device we need to jump through some hoops, follow my lead.  

- Install the required libraries:
```commandline
sudo apt-get -y install cmake build-essential libusb-1.0 qt4-qmake libpulse-dev libx11-dev qt4-default
```
- Clone the [rtl-sdr repo][3]
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr.git
```

- Install the rtl-sdr package.
```commandline
cd rtl-sdr/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

- Blacklist drivers  
Some people are reporting problems with conflicting drivers, so you might want to do this as a precaution.  
```commandline
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```
Add the following lines:
```commandline
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
blacklist rtl2832
blacklist rtl2830
```
Now reboot for the changes to take effect:
```commandline
sudo reboot -h 0
```

- Test rtl-sdr  
Run the `rtl_test` command, your output should look something like this:  
`Found X device(s):`, where X is the amount of devices found.
![rtl_test output][4]


Now we can communicate with the antenna, but now we need to listen to the P2000 service.  
According to [wikipedia][5] P2000 is a FLEX protocol that broadcasts on the `169,650 Mhz` band.  
Conclusion, we need some software that can decode the FLEX protocol, for this we use Multimon-NG.  

- Clone the [Multimo-NG repo][6]
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng
```

- Prepare the build
```commandline
cd multimon-ng
mkdir build
cd build
```
- Multimong-NG can be build with either Cmake or Qmake, in my case i used Cmake.

  - Cmake
    ```commandline
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
    ```
  - Qmake
    ```commandline
    qmake ../multimon-ng.pro
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

Now we are ready to test the device, if you have a stick with a `R820T` tuner use this command with optimized ppm(-p) and gain(-g) settings. The API itself relies on the `R820T` tuner.
```commandline
rtl_fm -f 169.65M -M fm -s 22050 -p 83 -g 30 | multimon-ng -a FLEX -t raw /dev/stdin
```
Else, use this.
```commandline
rtl_fm -f 169.65M -M fm -s 22050 | multimon-ng -a FLEX -t raw /dev/stdin
```

If all went well your output should look something like this:  
![P2000 output 1][7]  

It shouldn't take long for alarms to appear:  
![P2000 output 2][8]

Now, we need to setup the repo itself.  
All the settings are located at `./resources/config.json`.

First, install the requirements.
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This service can store units in a MongoDB database, i have included one that can easily be build with [Docker][9].  
This docker image holds a MongoDB database on a Ubuntu 16.04 image, the image exposes local port 27021 to be used for trafic.
This does not allow the container to be accessed from outside of your localhost.     

Build the image from the included Dockerfile.
```commandline
docker build -f ./resources/Dockerfile -t p2000_mongodb .
```
And start it with:
```commandline
docker run --name p2000_mongodb p2000_mongodb
```

Verify that it is running:
```commandline
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
bb1d860d0429        312a09e4f985        "/entrypoint.sh mongâ€¦"   2 hours ago         Up 2 hours          27017/tcp           p2000_mongodb
```
